## 1. Problem Statement

> The goal for this TypeScript Lexer is to identify all tokens in `./input.txt` and print them as a table to the console.

### Why JavaScript?

This semester, Professor Le instructed us to use whichever language we feel most comfortable with. In our case, that's JavaScript. The syntax is relatively easy to use and its asynchronous syntax might come in handy with Assignments 2 and 3.

With the massive adoption of the web, JavaScript has become the most sought-after programming language. It has proven to have the flexibility to tackle any project. It may not be as efficient as C, but it definetely can run as a compiler.

### Why TypeScript?

JavaScript was meant for the front-end. It started as a scripting language to manipulate the DOM and update HTML and CSS in the browser. In 2009, a Software Developer named Ryan Dahl, saw the potential in JavaScript and ported its runtime engine server-side called Node.js.

Node allowed front-end developers to use the syntax they were used to in the backend. This worked for small web hosting, but as applications grew in complexity, developers would soon realize this hacky language wouldn't scale as well as other languages.

Microsoft saw this as an issue as well when they began developing their [Visual Studio Code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/) in JavaScript. The code-base became so large that it was difficult to determine where runtime errors were originating from.

In 2012, Microsoft announced its efforts to develop a superset of JavaScript that allowed for statically typed variables as well as optional implementations of traditional object-oriented fundamentals.

Facebook also released their own version of a statically typed JavaScript superset, Flow, in 2014, but as you can see from [npm trends](https://www.npmtrends.com/flow-bin-vs-typescript), it's clear TypeScript is king.

## 2. Getting Started

This project requires the following :

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
3. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

### Installing Tools

#### Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system. It is used to download the code for this project. You are most likely viewing this document on Github, the most popular website for hosting git projects.

| OS      | Link                               |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Windows | https://git-scm.com/download/win   |
| MacOS   | https://git-scm.com/download/mac   |
| Linux   | https://git-scm.com/download/linux |

#### Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine. It allows JavaScript to run outside of the browser.

| OS      | Link                                                   |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Windows | https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.14.1/node-v12.14.1-x64.msi |
| MacOS   | https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.14.1/node-v12.14.1.pkg     |
| Linux   | https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.14.1/node-v12.14.1.tar.gz  |

#### TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript created by Microsoft. It adds static types and traditional object oriented programming fundamentals to JavaScript.

All code is written in TypeScript in the `src` folder and then transpiled to JavaScript in the `lib` folder using the `tsc` (TypeScript compiler) command.

TypeScript can be installed using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), the Node Package Manager. NPM is installed by default with every Node.js installation.

TypeScript is included as a dev dependency in each assignment's `package.json`. When you run `npm install` in a a folder with a `package.json` file it will install all packages listed in that file.

If you wish to install TypeScript globally on your machine you can use the following :

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

**Note**: make sure you have Node.js and npm installed at this point for the above command to work!

### Cloning the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/masautt/typescript-compiler
cd typescript-compiler
```

### Running the Lexer

```bash
cd as1
npm install
npm start
```

1. `cd as1` will navigate you to the folder for assignment 1

2. `npm install` will add the following packages to your `/node_modules/` folder.

```json
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/jest": "^25.1.1",
    "@types/node": "^13.7.0",
    "@types/table": "^4.0.7",
    "jest": "^25.1.0",
    "ts-jest": "^25.1.0",
    "typescript": "^3.7.5"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "table": "^5.4.6"
  }
```

3. `npm start` will run the TypeScript compiler with `tsc` which will transpile all the TypeScript files in `/src/` to JavaScript files in `/lib/`. Then, it will start the node application by running `node ./lib/index.js`

### Editing the Input to the Lexer

The lexer analyzes `./as1/input.txt`. You can manipulate this file to your liking.

### Testing

All tests are run through [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), an npm testing library developed by Facebook.

Jest is installed when you run `npm install` because it's included in `package.json`.

Run `npm test` to run all tests in `./as1/src/tests`.

### Data Structures

This project only uses the default JavaScript array. No complex data structures are used.

We could achieve faster runtimes with linked lists, but it's rather difficult to implement them in JavaScript, given the lack of pointers and deference operators.

### Algorithms

The only real algorithmic parts of this program are found in `cleaners.ts` and `tokenize.ts`.

#### getCleanInput( )

##### Purpose

Removes all unnecessary code (comments, newlines, tabs, etc.) and converts the input string into an input string array separated by spaces.

```typescript
export const getCleanInput = (input: string): string[] => {
    const newInput = removeAll(input);
    let cleanInput: string[] = [];
    newInput.split('').forEach((char: string) => {
        if (isKeychar(char) && char !== '.' && char !== ' ') {
            cleanInput.push(' ');
            cleanInput.push(char);
            cleanInput.push(' ');
        } else {
            cleanInput.push(char);
        }
    });
    return cleanInput
        .join('')
        .split(' ')
        .filter((e) => e !== '');
};
```

##### Steps

| #   | Code                                                     | Explanation                                                                                                 |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | `const newInput = removeAll(input)`                      | removes all comments / newlines                                                                             |
| 2   | `newInput.split('').forEach((char: string)`              | loops through newInput                                                                                      |
| 3   | `if (isKeychar(char) && char !== '.' && char !== ' ')`   | if the curr char is a keychar and not a `.` in a realnum, pad it with spaces                                |
| 4   | `else cleanInput.push(char)`                             | if not keychar then add it to the new array without padding                                                 |
| 5   | `cleanInput.join('').split(' ').filter((e) => e !== '')` | make the array into a string, split it back into an array based off spaces and then remove any extra spaces |

#### getTokens( )

#### Purpose

Loops through the input string array generated by `getCleanInput` and evaluates the token type of each word. Generates an object array with the value and token type as keys.

```typescript
export const getTokens = (input: string[]): Token[] =>
    input
        .filter((e) => e !== '')
        .map(
            (value: string): Token => {
                let type: TokenType = 'unknown';
                if (Tokens.isKeyword(value)) type = 'keyword';
                else if (Tokens.isSeparator(value)) type = 'separator';
                else if (Tokens.isOperator(value)) type = 'operator';
                else if (Tokens.isValidIdentifier(value)) type = 'identifier';
                else if (Tokens.isRealnum(value)) type = 'real';
                return { type: type, value: value };
            }
        );
```

##### Steps

| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | `input.filter((e) => e !== '')`                                  | remove any blanks                                                                          |
| 2   | `.map((value: string): Token => {`                               | loops through the input array                                                              |
| 3   | `let type: TokenType = 'unknown';`                               | create a new tokenType and set it to `undefined`                                           |
| 4   | `if (Tokens.isKeyword(value)) type = 'keyword';`                 | if the word is a part of the keywords array in `keywords.ts`, mark it as a `keyword`       |
| 5   | `else if (Tokens.isSeparator(value)) type = 'separator';`        | if the word is a part of the separators array in `separators.ts`, mark it as a `separator` |
| 6   | `else if (Tokens.isOperator(value)) type = 'operator';`          | if the word is a part of the operators array in `operators.ts`, mark it as a `operator`    |
| 7   | `else if (Tokens.isValidIdentifier(value)) type = 'identifier';` | if the word passes the regex test in `identifiers.ts`, mark it as an `identifier`          |
| 8   | `else if (Tokens.isRealnum(value)) type = 'real';`               | if the word passes the regex test in `realnums.ts`, mark it as a `real`                    |
| 8   | `return { type: type, value: value };`                           | return the new token                                                                       |

## 4. Limitations

To avoid any slowdowns with I/O, there is a `5KB` file size limit on input.txt. If the `stats.size` value is larger than the set `FILE_SIZE_LIMIT` in `./utils/env`, the lexer will not run on the file.

### Implementation

`./src/index.ts`

```typescript
const startLexer = (path: string) =>
    stat(path, (err: any, stats: Stats) =>
        err
            ? console.log(err)
            : stats.size >= FILE_SIZE_LIMIT
            ? console.log(FILE_SIZE_LIMIT_MSG)
            : readFile(path, 'utf8', (err: any, input: string) =>
                  err ? console.log(err) : tokenize(input)
              )
    );
```

### Other possible limitations

We could have checked for the number of new lines in `input.txt` but the lexer removes them anyways.

We chose not to put limitations on the size of integers and length of identifiers until the next assignment.

## 5. Shortcomings

We have several unit and integration tests in the `./src/tests` folder. If our lexer fails any requirements, it's probably not being tested for. If you find any missing requirements, we will be sure to test for them again in Assignment 2.
