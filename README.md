# CPSC 323 - Compilers and Programming Languages

### Lecturer : Anthony Le
![Demo](./as1/img/demo.GIF 'demo')

## Background

"Basic concepts of programming languages and principles of translation. Topics include history of programming languages, various programming paradigms, language design issues and criteria, design of compilers for modern programming languages." - _CSUF 2019-2020 University Catalog_

"This course is an introduction to the principles of Programming Languages and compiler design. The
course will cover some of the theoretical foundations underlying Programming Languages, compiler
design including study on regular languages, FSM, context free languages and different grammars.
Furthermore, the course will deal with the actual construction of the parts of a compiler and discuss more
advanced feature such as optimization. " - _Anthony Le's CPSC 323 Course Syllabus_

# Compiler Assigment

Students will be asked to build their own compiler that implements the following :

1. Lexical Analyzer (Assignment 1)
2. Syntax Analyzer (Assignment 2)
3. Semantic Analyzer (Assignment 3)

# Getting Started

This project requires the following :

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
3. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Installting Tools

## Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system. It is used to download the code for this project. You are most likely viewing this document on Github, the most popular website for hosting git projects.

### Installation

| OS      | Link                               |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Windows | https://git-scm.com/download/win   |
| MacOS   | https://git-scm.com/download/mac   |
| Linux   | https://git-scm.com/download/linux |

## Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine. It allows JavaScript to run outside of the browser.

### Installation

| OS      | Link                                                   |

## TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript created by Microsoft. It adds static types and traditional object oriented programming fundamentals to JavaScript.

All code is written in TypeScript in the `src` folder and then transpiled to JavaScript in the `lib` folder using the `tsc` (TypeScript compiler) command.

### Installation

TypeScript can be installed using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), the Node Package Manager. NPM is installed by default with every Node.js installation.

TypeScript is included as a dev dependency in each assignment's `package.json`. When you run `npm install` in a a folder with a `package.json` file it will install all packages listed in that file.

If you wish to install TypeScript globally on your machine you can use the following :

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

**Note**: make sure you have Node.js and npm installed at this point for the above command to work!

## Cloning the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/masautt/typescript-compiler
cd typescript-compiler
```

# Running the Compiler

Each assignment has a different version of the compiler. You need to navigate to each folder and install all npm packages to properly run each Node application.

## Assignment 1

```bash
cd as1
npm install
npm start
```

Running the above command navigates to assignment 1's directory, installs the following packages from `package.json` and starts the Node.js application.

```json
"devDependencies": {
    "@types/jest": "^25.1.1",
    "@types/node": "^13.5.2",
    "jest": "^25.1.0",
    "ts-jest": "^25.1.0",
    "typescript": "^3.7.5"
}
```

## Assignment 2

```bash
cd as2
npm install
npm start
```

Running the above command navigates to assignment 2's directory, installs the following packages from `package.json` and starts the Node.js application.

```json
"devDependencies": {
    "@types/jest": "^25.1.1",
    "@types/node": "^13.5.2",
    "jest": "^25.1.0",
    "ts-jest": "^25.1.0",
    "typescript": "^3.7.5"
}
```

## Assignment 3

```bash
cd as3
npm install
npm start
```

Running the above command navigates to assignment 3's directory, installs the following packages from `package.json` and starts the Node.js application.

```json
"devDependencies": {
    "@types/jest": "^25.1.1",
    "@types/node": "^13.5.2",
    "jest": "^25.1.0",
    "ts-jest": "^25.1.0",
    "typescript": "^3.7.5"
}
```
